## Guess game

This is a small game that let's the player guess a number between 1 and 100.
If the guess is more than 10 away from my number, I'll tell you you're COLD
If the guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're WARM
If the guess is farther than the most recent guess, I'll say you're getting COLDER
If the guess is closer than the most recent guess, I'll say you're getting WARMER
